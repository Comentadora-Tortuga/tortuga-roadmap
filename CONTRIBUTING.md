# 🤝 Contributing Guide

Welcome to **Turtle Code**.  
This project is not just software — it is an antifascist, anarchist, pro-Palestinian collective effort.  
Contributing means you share these values and respect the community.

## 🌍 Principles of Contribution
- **Respect the code of conduct** (see `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).
- Contributions should align with **antifascism, free software, and radical transparency**.
- No hierarchy: proposals are reviewed collectively, PRs are open to debate.
- All work is released under **AGPL-3.0** — improvements must remain free.

2. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
3. Make your changes, commit with clear messages (see below).
