# 🚩 Turtle Roadmap

Turtle Code does not move in straight lines — it grows as a swarm of contributions.  
This roadmap is not a rigid plan, but a living document of collective intent.

## 🌱 Phase 0: The Seed
- [x] Create roadmap repository.
- [ ] Define the initial dataset (categories: dehumanization, conspiracy, dogwhistles).
- [ ] Open Issues for first contributions.

## 🐢 Phase 1: The Linter
- [ ] Implement `misinfo-linter-js` (regex-based MVP).
- [ ] Publish as CLI + npm library.
- [ ] Add minimal test suite and GitHub Actions.

## 🌊 Phase 2: The Guardian Extension
- [ ] Build `tortuga-guardian-extension` (Chrome/Firefox MV3).
- [ ] Display score badge + popup with context.
- [ ] Highlight terms on page without breaking layout.
- [ ] Create multilingual datasets (starting with Spanish and English).

## 🌍 Phase 3: Community & Education
- [ ] Expand contributor guides with tutorials.
- [ ] Host online workshops on antifascist digital practices.
- [ ] Connect with sibling projects (RiseUp, Autistici, Chaos Computer Club, etc.).

## 🔮 Phase 4: Beyond
- [ ] Develop the `tortuga-sentinel-api` for analysis and anonymous reporting.
- [ ] Experiment with decentralized hosting (IPFS, Dat, federated systems).
- [ ] Research AI-based discourse analysis (always open, auditable, and antifascist).
