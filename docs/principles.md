# 🌱 Principles of Turtle Code

Turtle Code is not just software. It is a political and cultural project, rooted in antifascism, digital anarchism, and solidarity with Palestine.  
These principles guide every commit, every dataset, and every line of code.

## 🔥 Antifascism
Fascism thrives in digital propaganda, disinformation, and cultural manipulation.  
Turtle Code exists to detect, expose, and dismantle these mechanisms through free software.

## 🏴 Digital Anarchism
- No rigid hierarchies.  
- Collective decision-making.  
- Contributors are autonomous, not subjects.  
- Code and knowledge circulate freely.  

## 🇵🇸 Free Palestine
We recognize the struggle of the Palestinian people against colonialism and apartheid.  
Our project commits to refusing digital erasure and to standing in solidarity with the oppressed.

## 🤓 Nerd Pride
We embrace the joy of code, regex poetry, clean commits, and obsessive testing.  
Being nerds is not a weakness, it is our strength.

## 🔍 Radical Transparency
- All code is public and auditable.  
- All processes are open to scrutiny.  
- Nothing is hidden: reproducibility is a political stance.
