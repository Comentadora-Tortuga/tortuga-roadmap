# 🐢 Turtle Code — Roadmap

> *"The turtle moves slowly, yet its code breaks through walls."*  
> *"What algorithms present as real is nothing but the statistical echo of falsehood."*

This is the **central repository of Turtle Code**, a liberation project that uses free software to fight authoritarian propaganda, digital manipulation, and cultural fascism.

## 🌍 Principles
- Practical antifascism: **educate, document, liberate**.  
- Digital anarchism: no rigid hierarchies, collective decision-making, autonomy for contributors.  
- Free Palestine: this project acknowledges and stands in solidarity with the Palestinian struggle against colonialism and apartheid.  
- Nerd pride: we love code, linters, weird algorithms, and impossible regex.  
- Radical transparency: all code and processes are public and reproducible.  

## 📚 Contents
- `ROADMAP.md`: our technical and political roadmap.  
- `docs/principles.md`: extended explanation of principles.  
- Contribution and maintenance guides.  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Build an **antifascist linter** (`misinfo-linter-js`).  
- Create the **Tortuga Guardian extension**.  
- Develop open datasets with examples of manipulative discourse.
